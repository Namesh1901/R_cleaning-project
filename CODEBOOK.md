Code Book
The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
link of dataset:-https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Assign each data to variables
  features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
  The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and         tGyro-XYZ.

  activity <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
  List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

  subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
  contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

  x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features test data

  y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
  contains test data of activities’code labels

  subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
  contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

  x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
  contains recorded features train data

  y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
  contains train data of activities’code labels

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  combine_x(10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
  combine_y(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
  combine_subject(10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
  merge_data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging combine_subject,combine_x and combine_y using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  extms(10299 rows, 86 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data for  measurements on the mean and standard deviation      (std) for each measurement except combine_subject,combine_y.
  extmsn1(10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by combining combine_subject,combine_y and extms.It is require data frame.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Entire numbers in code column of the extmsn1 replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the            activitiy variable 
 
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  features column in extmsn1 renamed into Subjects
  code column in extmsn1 renamed into Activities
  All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
  All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
  All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
  All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
  All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  finalDat (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing extmsn1 taking the means of each variable for each activity and     each subject, after groupped by subject and activity by using select .
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
